# 2d-soft-body
A 2D soft body simulation that uses Euler integration. I'm planning to rewrite the whole code to incorporate Velocity Verlet integration instead due to the huge errors caused by Euler's method only being a first order approximation.

Uses raylib as the graphics API/OpenGL wrapper and raygui for the UI.
