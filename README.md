# Patchwork Engine + 2D Soft Body Simulation

This project has began to look more and more like a game engine. Wasn't planning the scope to get this big but here we go. I'll call it Patchwork Engine. The plan is to create a 2D only engine with some basic functionality. I'm curently hoping to get sounds, 2D physics + some basic graphics, saving/loading scenes and an event system working. Also, I'm planning to focus more on physics and doing some general OOP practice then learning an entire graphics API, hence why I'm using a 3rd party library to render the graphics. And unless I get a scripting system and a scene editor working, any apps using Patchwork will have to be closely integrated with the engine. 

The name's on purpose. I know very little about game engine design and I'm pretty sure I have a rough road ahead of me. No doubt the code base will be a bit messy. It'll be a patchwork of sorts.

Uses raylib as the graphics API/OpenGL wrapper and raygui for the UI.
