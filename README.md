# 2d-soft-body
A rewrite of the master branch. Planning to use Velocity Verlet integration and a component based data handling system. Will do some optimizations on math too, so I'm hoping this branch will run faster and also be more accurate at the same time.

Uses raylib as the graphics API/OpenGL wrapper and raygui for the UI.
