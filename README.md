# Patchwork Engine + 2D Soft Body Simulation

This project has began to look more and more like a game engine. Wasn't planning the scope to get this big but here we go. I'll call it Patchwork Engine.

The name's on purpose. I know very little about game engine design and I'm pretty sure I have a rough road ahead of me. So no doubt the code base will be a bit messy. It'll be a patchwork of sorts.

Uses raylib as the graphics API/OpenGL wrapper and raygui for the UI.
