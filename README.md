# Patchwork Engine + 2D Soft Body Simulation
A rewrite of the master branch. Planning to use Velocity Verlet integration and a component based data handling system. Will do some optimizations on math too, so I'm hoping this branch will run faster and also be more accurate at the same time.

This project has began to look more and more like a game engine. Wasn't planning the scope to get this big but here we go. I'll call it Patchwork Engine.

Uses raylib as the graphics API/OpenGL wrapper and raygui for the UI.
